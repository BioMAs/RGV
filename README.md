# RGV
The ReproGenomics Viewer (RGV) is a cross-species genomic toolbox for the reproductive community. The system is based on the implementation of a JBrowse genome browser and a Galaxy bioinformatics workflow environment. It was developed to provide a one-stop genomic working environment and aims to assist scientists in the analysis and the mining of a wide range of high-throughput repro-genomics data, including sequencing data.  RGV allows hosting, visualization, and direct comparison of usersâ€™ data to published genomics studies as well as to relevant genetic variations linked to reproduction. One way it does this is by enabling various genomic file format conversions.  The ReproGenomics Viewer currently hosts datasets that are oriented mainly towards testis biology and spermatogenesis. In the near future, these will extend to other areas of reproduction, including gonad development, urogenital cancers, and reproductive toxicology.
